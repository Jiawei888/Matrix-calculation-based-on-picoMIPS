# Matrix-calculation-based-on-picoMIPS
This project uses ModelSim and Quartus II software and is based on the Altera Cyclone V SoC 5CSEMA5F31C6 FPGA development board. By customizing processor operation instructions and building processor modules such as PC, register, decoder, ALU, etc., to implement a specified affine transformation algorithm that uses a toggle switch as the input N-bit of matrix binary values.
